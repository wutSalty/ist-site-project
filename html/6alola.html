                The <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Alola" class="bulb"> Alola region</a> is the seventh region that Ash Ketchum explores in his journey to become a Pokemon Master. The games Pokemon Sun and Moon, and Ultra Sun and Ultra Moon (which take place in an alternate dimention), added <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/List_of_Pok%C3%A9mon_by_Alola_Pok%C3%A9dex_number_(Ultra_Sun_and_Ultra_Moon)" class="bulb"> 86 new Pokemon</a>, as well as the inclusion of a new mechanic called "Z-Moves", which allows the player to unleash a super powerful move once per battle. These are part of "Generation 7" of Pokemon.

                Ash's journey thus far
            </h2>
            <p>
                After Ash's mother's Pokemon, Mr Mime, wins some free tickets to the Alola region, Ash and his mother decides to take a holiday to the Alola region. Upon arriving, Ash meets the local professor, Professor Kukui, and the class of students that he teaches at his school. After an encounter with one of the guardian deinties, Ash decides to join Professor Kukui's class and stay in the Alola region to learn about everything that the region has to offer.
                <br><br>
                Throughout Ash's journey in the Alola region, Kukui's class travels around the various islands of the Alola region learning about the diverse Pokemon while Ash participates in the island trials. However, it isn't as smooth sailing as the class might think. Team Rocket has also come to the Alola region to steal some Pokemon with unique "Alolan" forms. Ash and his friends also come across the hooligan group called Team Skull, who steal Pokemon only to cause mischief.
                <br><br>
                Mysterious Pokemon also appear throughout the Alola region, called Ultra Beasts. They come from alternate universes via the Ultra Wormholes. Ash and his friends make it their duty to help return any stranded Ultra Beasts to their universe. To do so, a task force called the Ultra Guardians were set up by Lusamine. Whenever an Ultra Beast was detected to have arrived in Alola, the Ultra Guardians are dispatched to return it to it's world.
                <br><br>
                At the end of the island challenges, Professor Kukui announces the first ever Alola league. With 151 participants, they all go head to head with each other until one person comes on top. For the first time in Pokemon history, Ash finally wins a Pokemon league. As his reward, he battles Professor Kukui in an exhibition match and comes out on top. Soon after, Ash and his friends parts ways, with Ash returning to the Kanto region.

                        Gladion is Lusamine's son and Lillie's older brother. He was first distant from the rest of his family due to the trauma that Lillie went through when they were infants.

During the Alola league, Ash battled Gladion for the rights to first place, where Ash came out on top.

                        Team Skull are less of a villainous team and more a gang of hooligans who steal other's Pokemon to cause chaos and to support themselves.

                        <br><br>
                        When Ash defeated Guzma during the Alola league, he considered his reputation to be tarnished and was on the cusp of disbanding Team Skull. However, his admins and grunts were so fired up from watching him battle, that they wanted Guzma to teach them how to battle like that. After the league, Team Skull can be seen training up with Guzma.
