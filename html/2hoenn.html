                Ash's journey thus far
            </h2>
            <p>
                After the events of Johto, Ash decides to travel to Hoenn with Pikachu to experience what the region has to offer! With a change of clothes, he sets off straight to the Hoenn region. Once Ash arrives, he meets up with the Professor of the Hoenn region, Professor Birch, to get him started in this new region. However, Ash also encounters his first companion, May, who was just beginning her Pokemon journey and decided to tag along. Not long after, the duo conveniently comes across Brock too, who had come from Kanto after finishing up there. Once the trio visits May's hometown Petalburg City, May's younger brother, Max, decides to tag along.
                <br><br>
                As Ash and his friends travel around the Hoenn region, they encounter numerous trainers and make a couple of rivals. In particular, May had rivalries against Drew and Harely. Meanwhile, Ash saw Morrison as his rival. Additionally, they also encountered the evil oranisations of the region, Team Aqua and Team Magma, who aim to flood the world or drain the earth, respectively. As well as the usual Team Rocket trio of Jessie, James and Meowth who followed Ash from the Johto region.
                <br><br>
                However, as history repeats itself, Ash comes up short of winning the regional tournament. Once again, he holds his head high as he hears about a Battle Frontier back in the Kanto region, a place where he will be able to further challenge himself. Leaving Max in the Hoenn region, Ash, May and Brock set off to the Kanto region to participate in the Battle Frontier.
                <br><br>
                Upon completion of the Battle Frontier, May decides to venture to Johto all by herself while Brock remains in Kanto for the meanwhile. Ash, learning of the Sinnoh region, decides to venture there himself.

                    May was Ash's first companion during his journey in the Hoenn region. After first meeting in Littleroot Town, May decided to join Ash's journey to learn more about Pokemon. Due to her father being a leader, she was expected to follow in his footsteps. However, she found her true calling in Pokemon contests, and decided to continue participating in them.
                    <br><br>
                    At the end of Battle Frontier, May journeys off to the Hoenn region by herself to participate in contests there.
                    <br><br>
                    May is also the older brother to Max, who also follows Ash on his journey.

                    Once Morrison and Ash were pitted against each other in a battle, Morrison found it extremely saddening he had to battle a good friend. At the end of it, he lost that battle and Ash moved on to the next round.

                    Team Aqua (left) and Team Magma (right) are the antagonist teams in the Hoenn region. Team Aqua aims to flood the world by reverting it's state for all Pokemon. On the other hand, Team Magma aims to expand the landmass for humans and human progress. To achieve this, they would have needed to capture the legendary Pokemon Kyogre and Groundon, who can control water and land, respectively.
